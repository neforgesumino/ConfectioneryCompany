My attemp to understand how Bootstrap works. I used Bootstrap 4 (I do know a new version have been announced, and I already know what exactly I will need to change in my mini-project to keep it working).
Whist working on that website, I had to read the documentation a lot. I used Bootstrap 4 features mainly in menu, gallery and carousel, the rest is more about CSS.
All pics are from google, I chose the colours and design myself, without outer help (maybe that's wife the website is not as pleasant to the eye as it could be).
Nevertheless, I enjoyed working on it.
